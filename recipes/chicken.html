       <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
       <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
       <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
       <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li>8 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
       <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook the chicken for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and golden brown. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
       <li>In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer.</li>
       <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and cook until the sauce thickens slightly, about 3-4 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
       <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
       <li>Slice the cooked chicken breasts into strips and add them to the Alfredo sauce. Stir to combine and heat through.</li>
       <li>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the sauce and chicken. Toss until the pasta is well coated with the sauce.</li>
       <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
   </ol>
