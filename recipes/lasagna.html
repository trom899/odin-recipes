   <h2>Extra Easy Lasagna</h2>
   <p>
       Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavor and hearty texture.
       To start, you'll need to prepare a savory meat sauce by browning ground beef or sausage
       with onions and garlic, then simmering it with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend
       of herbs like basil and oregano. Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to package
       instructions until al dente, and make a creamy ricotta cheese mixture by combining ricotta,
       egg, and a handful of grated Parmesan.
   </p>
   <p>
       Assemble the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish,
       followed by a layer of noodles, then a layer of the ricotta mixture, and a generous sprinkle
       of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with
       a top layer of meat sauce and a final sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake in a preheated
       oven at 375째F (190째C) for about 45 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden. Let the lasagna
       rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the layers to set, making for a perfectly sliceable
       and satisfying meal.
